  ## What is Summitward?

  ## The Math Behind It

  Every projection in Summitward is backed by peer-reviewed financial models:

  - **Monte Carlo methods** used by institutional investors — not single-point estimates
  - **Fama-French factor models** to decompose portfolio returns into systematic risk factors
  - **CEFR funded ratio** to measure your ability to meet future liabilities
  - **Confidence bands on every projection** — we show the full range of outcomes, not just the optimistic one
